***Part 1***
. NPM doesn't stand for Node Package Manager. It has no full form.
. Add npm init in the folder.
. Package.json is a configuration for npm. Packages are also known as dependencies.
. Add Bundler dependency to the code. Bundler helps you clean and pack all the code. Bundle bundles the app to send to production.
. In the project we will be using Parcel.
. In terminal, -D is for developer enviroment. Requires more clarification.
. ~2.8.3 and ^2.8.3 what is the difference. ~ will download only the major compatible updates of the package whereas ^ will also update the minor updates.
. package-lock.json keeps a track of exact version that is being installed.
. In package-lock.json, we can find integrity under parcel. Integrity is a hash.Sometimes when the project breaks in production it is responsible.
. Dependencies can have their own dependencies. This is called transitive dependencies.
. node_modules can be deleted/added in gitignore list. Can be added back using npm install.

***Part 2***
. npx parcel <file.html>
. In terminal, i and install is same same.
. <script type="module" src="./app.js"></script> type needs to be declared as module as it is not a normal javascript
. Parcel: It does HMR(Hot Module Replacement), Dev Build, Local Server, File Watching Algorithm(Written in C++), Caching(Faster build)
    , Image Optimization, Minifictaion, Bundling, Compressing, Consistence Hashing, Code Splitting, Differential Bundling(Support older browsers)
    , Diagnostic, Error Handling, Https, Tree Shaking(remove unused code)
. npx parcel build index.html: build is used for prod environment. remove line 4 with app.js from package.json.
.
